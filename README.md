# odin-recipes
This repo is for the Recipes HTML Project in the Odin Project curriculum.

This project will showcase a few of the skills I have learned so far:

## Skills:

- HTML: The web pages that I'm designing will show off basic HTML usage, including formatting HTML files, linking multiple files and folders together, and more.
- Git: I will be using Git to commit files and will be practicing writing commits messages.
- GitHub: I will be uploading my work to GitHub!
- Command Line: I am doing most of this in the terminal using the shell skills I've learned so far.
